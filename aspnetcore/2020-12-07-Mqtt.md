# MQTT
## Basic Concepts
- MQTT broker
The MQTT broker is responsible for dispatching messages between the sender and the **rightful** receivers.

- MQTT clients
1 an MQTT client **publishes** a message to a broker
2 other MQTT clients can **subscribe** to the broker to receive messages
3 each MQTT message includes a topic

- MQTT broker uses the topics and the subscriber list to dispatch messages to appropriate MQTT clients

- An MQTT broker is able to buffer messages that can't be dispatched to MQTT clients that are not connected.

- MQTT supports 3 different types of **qulity of services** messages:
0 - at most once
1 - at least once
2 - exactly once

- two version: MQTT 3.1.1 and MQTT 5
